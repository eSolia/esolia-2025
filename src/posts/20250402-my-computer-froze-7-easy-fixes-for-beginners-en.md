When your computer screen suddenly freezes while you're using it, it can be quite stressful, and frustrating especially if you’re busy. However, immediately forcing a shutdown or yanking the power plug can lead to data loss or make the situation worse. First, take a deep breath and stay calm. Then, try **the seven solutions** below.

## Wait for a While
If your computer is processing tasks and struggling to keep up, rushing and pressing multiple keys may make things worse. Confirm whether the access lamp is blinking, which indicates that your hard drive (HDD) or other storage device is actively reading or writing data. If it is, simply waiting a while can sometimes resolve the freeze. Try waiting at least **10 minutes** before taking further action.

## Disconnect Peripherals 
Sometimes, what seems like a frozen screen may actually be an issue with your external keyboard or mouse. If you're using external devices, check their connection:

&nbsp;&nbsp;**For wired devices**: Try unplugging and reconnecting the cable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;**For wireless devices**: Make sure Bluetooth is still connected and check if the battery is dead or needs charging. 

If your computer’s built-in keyboard or trackpad still works, the problem is likely with the external device. Wireless devices often run out of battery without warning, so it's a good idea to check them regularly. 

## Check External Mouse & Keyboard
Sometimes, connected USB devices or peripherals can cause your computer to freeze. Try unplugging all peripherals and checking whether the problem resolves. 

Common peripherals include: 

* Monitors
* Docking stations
* Headsets, earphones, or webcams
* External hard drives
* USB devices

## Try Keyboard Shortcuts to Force Close an App
Even if your computer appears completely frozen, certain keyboard commands may help restore functionality.

* Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Esc</kbd> to open the **Task Manager**, select the unresponsive app, and click **End Task**.

* Try <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch between open applications.
* Press <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> to refresh the display. 

## Sign Out
If the keyboard is still functional, signing out may help unfreeze your computer.

* Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Del</kbd> and select **Sign Out** from the menu.

## Restart Your Computer 
If possible, restarting your computer may resolve the issue.

* Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Del</kbd>, then click **Restart** from the lower-right corner of the screen.

##  Force Shutdown (Last Resort)  
If none of the above solutions work, you may need to **force shutdown** as a last resort. 

* Press and hold the power button for **10 seconds** or more until the computer turns off completely.
* Wait a few seconds, then turn the system back on.
* If you see a message saying "Windows was not shut down properly," select "Start Windows Normally".

Using a force shutdown can cause data loss, so it should only be used as a last resort. As a general rule, to prevent losing important data, make it a habit to save your work frequently.
