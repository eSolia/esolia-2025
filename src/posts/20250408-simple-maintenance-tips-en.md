## Remove dust from your PC 
Dust can reduce the cooling efficiency of your PC and lead to overheating. Use an air duster or brush to remove dust accumulated around the PC’s fan area and inside the USB and HDMI ports.

## Software Updates
By performing Windows Update, you can install the latest security patches, add new features, and improve performance. It is important to check for updates regularly and keep your system up to date. Additionally, make sure to update other software periodically as well.

## Disk Cleanup
Deleting unnecessary files can increase your disk space and improve your PC’s performance. Use the native Windows “Disk Cleanup” tool to regularly remove unwanted files.

## Restart PC
Using a computer for long periods or running multiple programs simultaneously can deplete memory and system resources, leading to slower performance. Regularly restarting your computer helps reset system resources and maintain smooth operation.

Regular maintenance is key to extending your PC’s lifespan and maintaining its performance. Give these tips a try!
