Every mobile device has a battery. And the battery condition will get gradually worse over time, lasting less time as you continue to use it. Windows offers a useful feature to check the battery status of your device by simply inputting a single command on the command line. Read on for a quick tip to check it on Windows laptops.

## 1. Open “Command Prompt”
The quickest way to open Command Prompt is: 

A. Press the <kbd>Windows</kbd> button
B. Type “cmd” in the search bar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

Once the command is entered, Command Prompt tells you that the battery report has been generated. 

> [!TIP]
> Just copy the folder path displayed in the black terminal window and paste it to Explorer using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>

Paste the folder path here and press Enter 

## 3. Check the Battery Report

> [!TIP]
> While **DESIGN CAPACITY** shows how much capacity the battery was originally designed with, **FULL CHARGE CAPACITY** shows this battery’s current capacity.

Full charge capacity will basically decrease over time, and this tells how much your laptop battery is deteriorating. If you find there is a substantial gap between Design Capacity and Full Charge Capacity, let’s say Full charge capacity is 70% that of Design Capacity, it’s a good time to replace the battery or the laptop itself.

**CYCLE COUNT** shows how many times you charged this battery. Generally, the battery needs to be replaced after 300~500 charge cycles.

This is the method to objectively check the deterioration of your laptop battery. If you have noticed that your laptop battery is running down quickly recently, try checking the battery status using the method above.
