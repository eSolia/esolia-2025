Are you facing issues where files won't open **after migrating to SharePoint Online?** In this article, we explain the differences in SPO's folder structure, URL limitations, access management, and _give some practical troubleshooting solutions_. We also provide a detailed guide on metadata management to enhance searchability!

## From On-Premises to the Cloud 

> Decommission all on-premises servers across all sites and move to the cloud!

This is a common refrain in foreign-affiliated companies. Often, projects are rolled out to local offices under directives from Global IT. In one such company, following an order from the Global IT Manager, the local IT team was tasked with reviewing its file server operations and migrating them to the cloud.

As a result, **SharePoint Online (SPO)** was introduced.

Migrating from an on-premises file server to SPO offers potential benefits such as cost reduction, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced security. However, because it operates differently from traditional file servers, hidden challenges often emerge.

This was not just a simple server migration—it was a major shift that required changes in operations and processes.

## Concerns Become Reality
The migration was successfully completed. However, the local IT team had lingering concerns:

> Is this really going to work? Will end users be able to adapt?

Their fears soon materialized as users began reporting issues: 

> I'm seeing an error, and I can’t access my files!

So, what exactly was the problem? Let’s break it down.

## SPO Limitations and Workplace Confusion 
With a strict deadline in place and limited time for careful implementation, the team aimed to minimize disruption by maintaining the existing operational approach, as much as possible, like so:

* **Access permissions were set per folder**
* **The same folder structure from the file server was carried over**

However, SPO is fundamentally different from on-premises file servers in its design. As a result, retaining the old folder structure led to frequent errors where files could not be opened. But why?

Many companies manage their files in deeply nested folder structures, categorizing files by year, client, and other attributes within multiple subfolders. However, in SPO, this approach leads to errors such as: 

"Files won’t open due to path length limitations!"  

> [!WARNING]
> **The root cause?** The folder structure was too deep, exceeding character limits.

To better understand the issue, let's examine SPO’s unique characteristics and the constraints it imposes.

## SharePoint Online Constraints 
### 1. Folder Structure Limitations

Deep folder structures are not recommended in SPO. Instead, a *metadata-driven approach* should be used for better searchability.

### 2. File Path Length Restrictions

When syncing files to a local PC and opening them via Windows Explorer, the file path is limited to 256 characters. Even if a file opens in SPO via your web browser, it may fail to open on a local PC if the path exceeds this limit. 

Here are the two main scenarios and their limits when opening files: 

**OneDrive Sync Client:** 

* When accessing synced files from Windows Explorer, the 256-character limit applies.
* If the folder structure is too deep, files may not open unless the path is shortened.

**Browser Access:** 

* If files are opened directly from the SharePoint Web interface, the local PC limit does not apply.
* However, SharePoint Online itself has a URL length limit of 400 characters. 

### 3. Leveraging Search Features
Instead of relying on deep folder structures, users can utilize metadata management and search functionality to find files more efficiently.
 
Since SPO follows a different architectural approach than traditional file servers, it cannot be used in the same way. A new operational strategy aligned with SPO’s capabilities is necessary. 

## Solutions

So in the end, how can we avoid the above issues and use SPO efficiently? 

* **Utilize metadata management** - instead of hierarchical folder structures, categorize files using "columns".
* **Split document libraries by use case** - keep folder structures as simple as possible.
* **Leverage search functionality** - locate files without opening folders.
* **Use shorter filenames** - prevent path length issues.
* **Establish a naming convention** for consistency (e.g., if the convention is **"Date_Project"**, then you might name a folder "20250107-New-Year-Planning". )

## Summary 
SPO migration projects don’t end with migration completion - they require ongoing adaptation to a more suitable operational model. By understanding SPO’s characteristics and establishing operational rules, companies can maximize the benefits of the cloud. One client shared with us:

> At first, it was confusing, but after using the search feature, I realized it made my work much easier!

To ensure more users share this sentiment, it’s essential to review operations and implement the right measures. 

**Next: Practical Metadata Management**

In Part 2, we’ll explore how to effectively manage metadata as an alternative to deep folder structures. This will help improve searchability and ensure smooth operations in SPO.
