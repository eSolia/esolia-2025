Are you leaving password management up to individual employees? Many cyberattacks start by exploiting weaknesses in password practices—often due to human error or poor internal management. If your company's password policies are too lax, a single compromised account could lead to a major data breach. In this article, we’ll break down five key strategies IT professionals should implement to strengthen internal password management. From realistic policy setting based on the latest NIST guidelines, to effective tool usage and employee education, we’ll cover practical steps you can take to protect your organization.

## Why Is Password Management Important?
Many corporate security risks stem from poorly managed passwords. Weak or reused passwords often become targets for cyberattacks. Phishing attacks and credential leaks are increasing, leading to unauthorized access that can cause significant damage to businesses. 

## Five Key Points to Strengthen Password Management 

### 1.Establish and Enforce a Password Policy 
To maintain password strength while minimizing user frustration, consider adopting the following rules based on recommendations from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology): 

* Minimum password length of 8 characters (using 15 characters or more in a passphrase format is highly recommended)
* Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols is optional (length is more important than complexity)
* Regular password changes are not required (unless there's evidence of compromise)
* Disallow the use of known leaked passwords (compare against breach databases where possible)
* Avoid reusing passwords across multiple systems (especially for work-related accounts)

NIST’s latest guidelines emphasize **length over complexity** and **maintaining secure passwords over enforcing periodic changes.** Forcing regular updates often leads to predictable patterns (e.g., Spring2024! → Summer2024!), which can weaken security rather than enhance it.

### 2.Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if a password is compromised. Consider using: 
* One-time passwords (OTP)
* Authentication apps (such as Microsoft or Google Authenticator)
* Hardware tokens

### 3.Utilize a Password Manager 
Password managers such as Zetetic [Codebook](https://www.zetetic.net/codebook/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (eSolia’s choice) or 1Password help employees generate and store strong passwords securely, in an encrypted database application. Benefits include: 

* Automatic generation and secure storing of strong passwords
* Preventing password reuse
* Checking if your passwords were leaked in a security breach
* Ease of entering your passwords when requested

### 4.Strengthen Access Control
Apply **the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** by granting only necessary access rights, and consider “Just in Time” access rights allocation solutions, such as M365 PIM. 
Additionally: 
* Regularly review access permissions
* Properly manage accounts of former or transferred employees

### 5.Employee Education and Regular Security Training 
Password security is not just an IT issue; all employees should understand its importance. 
Conduct training on: 
* Identifying phishing emails
* Raising awareness of security best practices
* Simulated attacks to test employees’ responses

At eSolia, in addition to taking part in security training, all employees create a monthly quiz based on articles from the magazine Nikkei Network, covering a wide range of IT and security topics. These quizzes are then delivered daily through TMC, our attendance and work tracking app, in a True/False format. This unique initiative helps reinforce both security awareness and overall IT knowledge as part of our everyday workflow. 

## Conclusion
Strengthening password management is a fundamental part of corporate cybersecurity. IT managers and decision-makers must lead efforts in setting policies, implementing security tools, and educating employees. Start by assessing your company’s current password management practices and take steps to enhance security today!
